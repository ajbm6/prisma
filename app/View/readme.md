# View

The View's job is to translate data into a visual rendering for response to the Client
(ie. web browser or other consumer). The data will be supplied primarily by the Controller; 
however, the View may also have a helper that can retrieve data that is associated with 
the rendering and not necessarily with the current request (ex. aside data, footer data).

#### Model: Service layer

This layer provides cohesive, high-level logic for related <br>
parts of an application. This layer is invoked directly by <br>
the Controller and View helpers. <br>

The business logic should be placed in the model service layer, <br>
and we should be aiming for fat models and skinny controllers.
